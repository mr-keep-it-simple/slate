## TODOs

- <strike>Install Slate GitHub project on local machine</strike>
- <strike>Find out how to generate static files and send to David</strike>
- Solution:
  - Open up docker image in terminal window
  - run > bundle exec middleman build
  - This build all static web pages to the build folder
- Add Merge function to cloudstore doc (https://lodash.com/docs#merge)
- Add Delete function to cloudstore doc
- Document media files (upload, delete, manage, password protect)
- Document dashboard (cloudstore control panel)
- write demo code to test

===================
- Sub headings for web page:
  - Data
  - Media
  - Dashboard

  - Examples for password protection 
    - News updates - (data): select editors allowed update the data file with a password prompt
    - News flash or promotion image - Loaded through CloudStore dashboard or special admin app or admin mode/section with password prompt
    - Media paths are unique and unguessable (non sequential) for safe sharing publically or privately
    - E-commerce

 - Add warning to not hard code password into code (use warning alert)

 - Add password argument for media Upload function
