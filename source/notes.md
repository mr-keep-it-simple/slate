## Control Panel observations

- When using the File Uploader tool and I add too many files I get the error: ERROR: You have reached your maximum number of files so this file will be discarded.
  This message is a little confusing as it doesn't tell you what file(s) will be discarded.

- When using the File Uploader tool there is no back button to get back to the control panel home screen

- When pressing delete could we have a dialog confirm box before the deletion process occurs?
